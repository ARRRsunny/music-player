# Music Player

This project is a lightweight, containerized music player application built with Flask, Nginx, and Docker. It comes with a simple web-based UI for playback control, song management, and radio functionality. The application is designed to serve audio files, lyrics, and album art, while supporting various playback modes such as looping, queueing, and random play.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Docker Compose**: Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- **ZeroTier (Optional)**: If you want to access the app from an external network, you can use [ZeroTier](https://www.zerotier.com/).
- Music files should be placed in a `music` directory in the root of the project.

---

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ARRRsunny/music-player.git
   cd music-player
   ```

2. **Prepare Your Music Files**:
   - Create a folder named `music` in the root directory.
   - Add your `.mp3`, `.flac`, `.wav`, `.lrc`, `.jpg`, and `.png` files to the `music` folder.

3. **Edit the Address in `nginx.conf`**:
   - Open `nginx.conf` and replace `youraddress:8080` with either:
     - Your **local machine's IP address** (e.g., `192.168.x.x:8080`).
     - Or, your **ZeroTier IP address** if you're using ZeroTier.

   Example:
   ```nginx
   server_name 192.168.1.100:8080; # Replace with your IP
   ```

4. **Build and Start the Containers**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://<your-ip>:8080`.

## UI Overview

The UI (`musicplayer_server.html`) is served by the Flask backend and provides the following features:

1. **Play and Pause**:  
   - Button: `‚ñ∂Ô∏è`  
   - Start or pause the playback of the selected song.

2. **Playback Time Display**:  
   - Displays the current playback time in the format `0:00`.

3. **Volume Control**:  
   - Button: `üîä`  
   - Adjusts the playback volume.

4. **Previous and Next Song**:  
   - Buttons:  
     - `‚è™`: Plays the previous song in the queue.  
     - `‚è©`: Skips to the next song.

5. **Playback Modes**:  
   - `Loop`, `Random`, `Once`, `Queue`, and `Radio`.

6. **Lyrics Display**:  
   - Section: `Lyrics will appear here...`  
   - Displays the lyrics for the currently playing song if available.

7. **Address Input**:  
   - Section: `Address` with a `send` button.  
   - Allows users to input and send specific commands or addresses.

## API Endpoints

### Flask API

- **`GET /`**  
  Serves the web interface from `musicplayer_server.html`.

- **`GET /songs`**  
  Returns a JSON object with all available songs and their IDs.

- **`GET /<song_id>/<file_type>`**  
  Serves specific file types (`audio`, `image`, `lyrics`) for a given song ID.  
  Example: `/1/audio` serves the audio file for song ID 1.

- **`GET /radio`**  
  Returns the current song ID and elapsed time in the radio loop.

---

## Deployment and Configuration

### Flask Address

The Flask application runs on `0.0.0.0` to ensure it listens on all network interfaces. Nginx forwards requests from the specified address in `nginx.conf` to the Flask backend.

**Important**: Update the `nginx.conf` file with your own IP address to make the application accessible from your network or ZeroTier.

---

## Example Use Cases

1. **List Songs**:
   - Request: `GET /songs`
   - Response:  
     ```json
     {
       "0": "song1",
       "1": "song2"
     }
     ```

2. **Fetch Audio File**:
   - Request: `GET /0/audio`
   - Response: Returns the `.mp3`, `.flac`, or `.wav` file for song ID `0`.

3. **Radio Loop**:
   - Automatically plays a random song every time the timer expires.

---

## Docker Configuration

### Flask Service

- **Dockerfile**:
  - Based on `python:3.9-slim`.
  - Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
  - Exposes port `8080` for Flask.

### Nginx Service

- **Dockerfile-nginx.txt**:
  - Based on `nginx:alpine`.
  - Copies the custom `nginx.conf` file into the container.
  - Configures Nginx to listen and proxy requests to Flask.

### Networking

- Both services are connected to a `bridge` network named `app-network`.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Music Directory Not Found**:
   - Ensure the `music` directory exists and contains valid audio files.

2. **Nginx Fails to Start**:
   - Check the `nginx.conf` file for syntax errors.

3. **Flask Crashes**:
   - Check the Flask logs for errors using:
     ```bash
     docker-compose logs flask
     ```

4. **API Not Accessible**:
   - Ensure the containers are running:
     ```bash
     docker-compose ps
     ```
